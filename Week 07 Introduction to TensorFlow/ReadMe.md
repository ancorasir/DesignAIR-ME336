# Week 07 Introduction to TensorFlow
In today's lab session, we will introduce some widely used deep learning frameworks, and run tutorials of tensorflow.


## [Deep Learning Frameworks](https://developer.nvidia.com/deep-learning-frameworks):
 Deep learning frameworks offer building blocks for designing, training and validating deep neural networks, through a high level programming interface. Following is a list of popular deep learning frameworks:
  - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): PyTorch is a GPU accelerated tensor computational framework with a Python front end.
  - [MXNet](http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/get_started?): MXNet is a deep learning framework designed for both efficiency and flexibility. It allows you to mix the flavors of symbolic programming and imperative programming to maximize efficiency and productivity.
  - [TensorFlow](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tensorflow-user-guide/index.html): TensorFlow is an open-source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs.

  - [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/solutions/deep-learning.html): MATLAB makes deep learning easy for engineers, scientists and domain experts. With tools and functions for managing and labeling large data sets, MATLAB also offers specialized toolboxes for working with machine learning, neural networks, computer vision, and automated driving.
  - [NVIDIA Caffe](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/caffe-user-guide/index.html): NVCaffe<sup>TM</sup> is an NVIDIA-maintained fork of  the [Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC)](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) Caffe tuned for NVIDIA GPUs, particularly in multi-GPU configurations.
  - [Chainer](https://chainer.org/): Chainer is a Python-based deep learning framework aiming at flexibility.
  - [PaddlePaddle](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/): PaddlePaddle provides an intuitive and flexible interface for loading data and specifying model structures. It supports CNN, RNN, multiple variants and configures complicated deep models easily.

  ## TensorFlow Tutorials
  The official tutorial of tensorflow is [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials). And we get a quick start from MNIST referring to [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-tensorflow-mnist/#0) step by step.

- [TensorFlow Basics](https://www.guru99.com/tensor-tensorflow.html): Tensor, Shape, Type, Graph, Sessions & Operators
- Tutorials: the examples are handwritten digits classification and image classification. The datasets used is [MNIST]((http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)) and [FASHION MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist#get-the-data), and they have been downloaded as mnist.npz and Fashion-MNIST in week07 folder.

## TensorFlow Installation
As [TensorFlow](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#windows-anaconda)=2.x is not available from conda, we use pip to install it.
> ``pip install tensorflow==2.0``
> #if it's too slow, use other source like below    
> ``pip install tensorflow==2.0 -ihttps://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple/``

## TensorFlow Tutorials
The official tutorial of tensorflow is [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials). And we also get some quick starts:
- **[mnist](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)**: run the [mnist.ipynb](./mnist.ipynbb). You can also refer to this [link](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner).
- **[Fashion_mnist](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist#get-the-data)**: Install matplotlib first as we need show figures ``conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib``; then run the [Fashion_mnist.ipynb](./Fashion_mnist.ipynb). You can also refer to this [link](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification).
