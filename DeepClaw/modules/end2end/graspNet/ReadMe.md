## GraspNet Modified from AlexNet
AlexNet is the name of a convolutional neural network (CNN), designed by Alex Krizhevsky,[1] and published with Ilya Sutskever and Krizhevsky's doctoral advisor Geoffrey Hinton. This CNN is modified from AlexNet by adding an additional angle path for satisfying need of picking prediction.

There are two methods available. FCGraspNet is a fully convolutional network which can reduce reputation time largely.

The usage example can be found in fc_predictor.py.
